It can also be seen that there are four different data types in the tabular (int64, object, float64, bool)

The first two columns' datatype are int64, showing each tree's plot and ID

Object datatype are used to describe each tree's Survey Date, Species, Land Use, Crown Condition and Comments

Float64 is frequently used to describe various data about the tree, including DBH(cm), DBH Height(m) and Total Height(m)
