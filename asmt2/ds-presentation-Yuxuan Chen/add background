In Goccia, more than 2,500 tall trees have replaced industrial areas that were abandoned 20 years ago. 

More than 20 years ago, the industrial area around the former gas plant between Bovisa and Villapizzone train stations was closed and abandoned.

The roots of these plants have broken through reinforced concrete, which covers most areas, 
and have multiplyed in large numbers: "Plants have reoccupied space and created a new ecosystem."
